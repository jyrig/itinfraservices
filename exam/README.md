Exam pre-requisites
-------------------

The only requirement is: your GitHub repository should contain 10 directories
with lab solutions, `lab1` .. `lab10` (9 for Monday group).


How will exam look like
-----------------------

You will get the exact task once the exam starts. It will be very similar to
example tasks, but with minor differences, so if you can solve the example task
-- you can be pretty confident that you can pass the exam rather easily.

You will have 3 hours (180 minutes) to solve it and present your solution.
Solutions are checked on first-come-first-served basis.

Once ready, you let us know your GitHub username, and we will verify that:
 - your GitHub repository contains all the lab solutions
 - you exam code works

**Note:**
**We will only check the code in your GitHub repository, not on your machine.**
**Make sure all the needed code is uploaded to your GitHub repository.**

Then we will ask you a few questions about your exam code and if needed, about
your labs. Most probably we will ask you to explain what this or that code block
does, or to do some minor configuration change (port, username, password etc.).

If you can answer the questions, the exam is considered passed.
